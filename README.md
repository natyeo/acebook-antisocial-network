## Quickstart



Acebook-Antisocial-Network

This week we commenced our development of the Anti-Social Network. We outlined a series of tickets on Trello in order to ensure that misanthropic communication can remain as effective as possible this holiday season. Our primary goal for today is to create a full-stack signup consisting of routes, databases, and views. In the course of this sprint, we aspire to write tickets, whilst prioritizing broader learning principles, such as clean code, and DRY. We hope to continue finding our synergy as a group as we further pursue our goal of building a premier anti-social networking platform. Stay tuned for updates.
